            <h3>Game Options</h3>
            <p>You do not need to enter any game options to play the game, they are optional.

            <p>This game is meant to be challenging but still fun. If you are having difficulty remembering the full sequence please feel free to lower the game options.</p>
            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>After you select "Start Round" get ready for the fun to begin!</p>
            <p>After a very short delay the first glass will blink. You will need to select the correct glass. If you select the correct glass the first two glasses will blink in a sequence. You will need to select the correct glasses in the correct sequnce to pass the round.</p>
            <p>The sequence will continue to grow until the max sequence is reached.</p>
            <p>Each successful round costs $5. Be careful because you only came to the bar with a certain amount of money.</p>
            <h3>Bribery</h3>
            <p>Did you accidentally click the wrong glass? That's ok. If you have enough money you can choose to tip the bartender for the chance to try again.</p>
            <p>Be careful if you choose to do this. The bartender will not always accept tips and the amount is different every time. You may get kicked out of the bar anyway!</p>
