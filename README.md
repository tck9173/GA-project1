Title: Beat the Bartender 
Description: So you think you need another drink? Not so fast. First you need to pass this test...

The game starts with three shot glasses for the first round. The bartender will point to a shot glass and you have to remember which glass they pointed to. Each round you have to repeat the sequence starting with one shot glass working up to five. If you successfully remember the full sequence of five you are allowed another drink (Possible hard mode: BUT that glass is added to the game board for the next round. You are allowed more drinks as long as you can remember the sequence.) If you do not remember the sequence you are kicked out of the bar!

(Hard mode only: No one is allowed more than eight drinks.)

Remember to tip your bartenders.

Simon says game with a max sequence of five. If you complete the max sequence of five you win the round.

Game needs a counter to show the rounds won.

Need two buttons. One to start a round and one to reset the game.

Gameplay:

-One glass will glow, move, or wiggle.

-User clicks correct glass.

-The first glass will glow again, then a new glass will glow. 

-User clicks the shot glasses in the correct order.

-This continues up to a max sequence of 5.

-If at any time the user selects the wrong glass, throw a popup that tells the user they got kicked out of the bar.

-If the user remembers the correct sequence of 5 throw a popup congratulating the user.
