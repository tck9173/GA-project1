# Title: Beat the Bartender 
# Description: So you think you need another drink? Not so fast. First you need to pass this test...

# The game starts with three shot glasses for the first round. The bartender will point to a shot glass and you have to remember which glass they pointed to. Each round you have to repeat the sequence starting with one shot glass working up to five. If you successfully remember the full sequence of five you are allowed another drink, BUT that glass is added to the game board for the next round. You are allowed more drinks as long as you can remember the sequence. If you do not remember the sequence you are kicked out of the bar!

# No one is allowed more than eight drinks.

# Remember to tip your bartenders.
